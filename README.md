# Insiders Program for an E-Commerce Company
Insiders Program Project 

The following context is completely fictitious, the company, the context and the CEO. The business questions are also fictional but were made in an attempt to exemplify how they would be required in a business work environment.

# Introduction
This is a data science clustering project done for a company called All In One Place, which aims to create a loyalty program for its most valued customers based on their purchases.

### Step 01. Data Description
In this step, some aspects of the dataset were verified, such as: column names, dimensions, data types, checking and filling in missing data (NA), descriptive analysis of the data and what are its categorical variables.

### Step 02. Filtering Variables
Checking the necessity to filter the dataset based on a variable that does not matter to the project itself.

### Step 03. Featuring Engineering
In featuring engineering, new attributes (columns) were derived based on the original variables, enabling a better description of the phenomenon of that variable.

### Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Space Study
Exploration of Data in order to find Insights for a better understanding of the Business. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyzes were also performed, obtaining some statistical properties that describe them, and more importantly, the correlation between the variables.

### Step 05. Data Preparation
Session that deals with the preparation of data so that Machine Learning algorithms can be applied. Some types of scaling and encoding were performed so that the categorical variables became numerical.

### Step 06. Hyper Parameter Fine Tuning
Training of Machine Learning models. The model that presented the best performance against the database with applied cross-validation proceeded to the hyper parameterization of the variables of that model, aiming to optimize the generalization of the model.

### Step 07. Model Training
The best parameters were found that maximize model learning. These parameters were defined by using the Optuna framework for automating the optimization process of these hyperparameters. It automatically searches for and finds optimal hyperparameter values by trial and error for excellent performance.

### Step 08. Cluster Analysis
In this step, the performance of the model was analyzed from a business perspective, and translated into business value.

### Step 9. Data Analysis Exploration Post Cluste Profile
Publication of the model in a production environment in the cloud (Heroku) so that people or services can access the results and thus improve the company's business decision.

### Step 10. Model to Deploy Production (AWS)
